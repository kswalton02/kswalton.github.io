The username of my account is kswalton02 and it contains the repositories I created.
The repository I created is called kswalton.github.io and it's the first repository I've created in CTI-110.
I first logged into my Github account. Then I clicked on the "+" icon and selected "Clone a repository". I chose the repository I wanted to clone and chose its desired location. I finalized the cloning by clicking "Clone repository".
